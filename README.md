# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
This project builds an app to scrape NASA webites to extract different types of Mars data then create an HTML page to display the findings. The data is stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. 

## The Scrapped Data
### Mars' News Data, Featured Image, & A Collection of Facts

- The full size image that is currently featured from NASA's Space Images webpage.
